This script will make your mining turtle strip mine in a zig-zag fashion; First it goes forward a hardcoded number of blocks (mining everything in its way), then it turns (first right, then left, and so on) to bank back the way it came, parallel to the strip it just cut out.

It (should) will run until it runs out of fuel.
